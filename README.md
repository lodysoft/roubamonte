Traditional card game to teach kids how to play with cards.

Code style convention:
---------------------

1) **Hungarian notation:** it's a camel case in which every variable name is preceded by its type in three or less lowercase letters, sometimes four or five, if there aren't better options.

2) Function names should be lowercase_with_underscores_where_spaces_should_be. Python style.

3) Spaces before and after comparison, assignment, arithmetic and stream operators. NO spaces inside parentheses, square brackets or curly braces.

4) Curly braces in a newline, so they MATCH each other vertically.
