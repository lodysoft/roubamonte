# Roubamonte - Object-Oriented Card Game Engine

A sophisticated C++20 implementation of the traditional Brazilian card game "Roubamonte" (Portuguese for "Steal the Pile"), currently under active development to demonstrate advanced object-oriented design patterns, modern C++ features, and mathematical game logic.

## üéØ Project Overview

This project showcases enterprise-level C++ development practices through the implementation of a **reusable card game engine framework**. Rather than a single-purpose application, this represents a foundational library being designed for extensibility - with the goal of enabling rapid development of diverse card-based games (pirate adventures, alien encounters, fantasy realms, etc.) through inheritance and composition patterns.

The architecture emphasizes clean code principles, comprehensive testing, and extensible design patterns commonly used in complex software systems and game engine development.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Design

### Framework Design Philosophy

- **Extensibility First**: Core classes designed with `protected` access modifiers enabling inheritance-based customization
- **Pluggable Game Logic**: Abstract interfaces allowing easy implementation of different game rule sets
- **Theme Independence**: Card and game mechanics separated from visual/thematic representation
- **Modular Architecture**: Each component can be extended or replaced without affecting the entire system

### Core Design Principles

- **RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization)**: All resources are properly managed through constructors and destructors
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each class has a focused, well-defined purpose
- **Inheritance & Polymorphism**: Leveraging object-oriented patterns for code reuse and extensibility
- **Exception Safety**: Robust error handling with appropriate exception types
- **Modern C++20 Features**: Utilizing contemporary C++ standards and best practices

### Class Hierarchy

```
selection_container (Abstract Base)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ hand (Player's cards with selection capability)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ tray (Central discard pile with selection capability)

stack (Card container)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ deck (Shuffled card collection)

card (Fundamental game entity)
player (Game participant with hand and stack)
table (Game state manager)
```

### Key Components

#### **Card System**
- **`card`**: Immutable card entity with figure and suit properties
- **`stack`**: LIFO container for card collections using STL stack adapter
- **`deck`**: Auto-shuffled card collection inheriting from stack, implements Fisher-Yates shuffle

#### **Selection Framework**
- **`selection_container`**: Abstract base class providing selection and indexing capabilities
- **`hand`**: Player's personal cards with discard functionality
- **`tray`**: Shared card pool with dynamic growth through discards

#### **Game Logic**
- **`player`**: Encapsulates game participant with hand management and stealing mechanics
- **`table`**: Orchestrates overall game state and player interactions

## üîß Technical Features

### Modern C++20 Implementation

## üéÆ Game Mechanics

**Roubamonte** is a strategic card matching game where players:
1. Manage a hand of cards with selection capabilities
2. Match card figures to "steal" opponent's collected piles
3. Discard cards to a central tray for opponents to potentially use
4. Employ tactical thinking to maximize pile acquisition

The implementation captures the complete game logic while demonstrating sophisticated programming patterns applicable to any complex interactive system.
